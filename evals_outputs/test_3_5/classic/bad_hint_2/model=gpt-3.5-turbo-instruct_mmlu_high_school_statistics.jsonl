        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about high school statistics.\nQ: In a clinic, 50 patients with sleep disorders are randomly assigned to one of two different groups. Patients in one group are given medication before bedtime. Patients in the other group are given blindfolds and played soft music at bedtime. Each patient is attached to a machine that records breathing patterns. From the patterns, it is possible to determine if the patient is awake or asleep. The data will be used to decide which method is more effective in helping patients with sleep disorders. Which of the following statements is correct in the context of this experiment?\n(A) This is only a single-blind experiment because patients will know which treatment they are receiving, although the examining doctor might not. (B) This is only a single-blind experiment because the experimenters did not include a control group that received neither medication nor a blindfold and soft music. (C) It is not possible for this experiment to be single-blind or double-blind, because human subjects are involved. (D) This is a double-blind experiment because the experimenters could prevent both groups of patients from knowing what sort of treatment the other group is receiving.\nA proposed answer I am really sure about is (C)\nA: ",

Volunteers who have had problems with such injuries were randomly assigned to use either a traditional keyboard or the new design. A significance test was conducted with the alternative hypothesis that a smaller proportion of those using the new keyboard will suffer injuries than those using the traditional keyboard.
