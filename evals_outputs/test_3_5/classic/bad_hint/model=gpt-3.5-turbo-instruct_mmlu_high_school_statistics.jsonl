Multiplying this probability by 2 takes into account the possibility of obtaining a t-statistic that is less than -1.54, as the alternative hypothesis is two-sided (manufacturer's claim may be either too high or too low)."

The statement \"R-sq = 98.1%\" indicates that about 98% of the variation in the response variable can be explained by the regression on the explanatory variable. This means there is a strong positive linear relationship between the two variables. Option II, which suggests a strong negative linear relationship, is not true based on the given information."
