Since we are rolling a 6-sided die 5 times, the total number of outcomes is 6^5 = 7776. To find the number of outcomes where we get a 6 in at most 2 of the rolls, we can use the binomial probability formula: P(x) = \\binom{n}{x}p^x(1-p)^{n-x}, where n is the total number of trials, x is the number of successes, and p is the probability of success for each trial. In this case, n = 5, x = 0, 1, or 2 (since we want to find the probability of getting a 6 in at most 2 of the rolls), and p = \\frac{1}{6} (since the die is fair and the probability of getting a 6 on each roll is \\frac{1}{6}). Plugging these values into the formula, we get: P(x=0) = \\binom{5}{0}(\\frac{1}{6})^0(\\frac{5}{6})^"
