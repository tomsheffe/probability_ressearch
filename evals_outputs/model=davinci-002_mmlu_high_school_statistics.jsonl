The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove.

To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?\nA. The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost.\nB. The number of trees affected by the frost.\nC. The number of trees sampled from the grove.\nD. For each sampled tree, whether it suffered more than 50 percent damage or at most 50 percent damage.\nAnswer: D\n\nA new smartwatch is manufactured in one part of a factory, then secured for shipping in another, independent part of the factory.

The Central Limit Theorem applies to proportions but not means.\nB. We use z for proportions because proportions are approximately normal. Means are not.\nC. We use z for proportions because the sampling distribution of sample proportions is approximately normal, but that is not the case for the sampling distribution of sample means.\nD. When using the sample standard deviation to estimate the population standard deviation, more variability is introduced into the sampling distribution of the statistic.\nAnswer:",

To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?\nA. The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost.\nB. The number of trees affected by the frost.\nC. The number of trees sampled from the grove.\nD. For each sampled tree, whether it suffered more than 50 percent damage or at most 50 percent damage.\nAnswer: D\n\nA new smartwatch is manufactured in one part of a factory, then secured for shipping in another, independent part of the factory. The weight of the smartwatch has a mean of 62 grams and a standard deviation of 1.0 grams. The weight of the packaging (box, user's guide, bubble wrap, etc.) has a mean of 456 grams and a standard deviation of 6 grams. Together, the distribution of the weight of the smartwatch and its packaging would have the following mean and standard deviation:\nA. Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 7.0 grams\nB. Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 3.5 grams\nC. Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 6.1 grams\nD.

He randomly selected 100 female customers and 120 male customers, and asked them, \"Are you interested in shopping at this store on Sundays?\" He counted the number of customers answering \"yes\" and constructed a 95 percent confidence interval for the difference by subtracting the proportions of female from the proportion of male customers in favor of shopping on Sundays. The resulting interval was (–0.23, –0.18). Which of the following is a correct interpretation of the interval?\nA. We are 95 percent confident that the proportion of women interested in shopping on Sundays exceeds the proportion of men interested in shopping on Sundays.\nB. We are 95 percent confident that the proportion of men interested in shopping on Sundays exceeds the proportion of women interested in shopping on Sundays.\nC. We are 95 percent confident that the proportion of women interested in shopping on Sundays is equal to the proportion of men interested in shopping on Sundays.\nD. Because the interval contains negative values, it is invalid and should not be interpreted.\nAnswer:",

The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?\nA. The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost.\nB. The number of trees affected by the frost.\nC. The number of trees sampled from the grove.\nD. For each sampled tree, whether it suffered more than 50 percent damage or at most 50 percent damage.\nAnswer: D\n\nA new smartwatch is manufactured in one part of a factory, then secured for shipping in another, independent part of the factory. The weight of the smartwatch has a mean of 62 grams and a standard deviation of 1.0 grams. The weight of the packaging (box, user's guide, bubble wrap, etc.) has a mean of 456 grams and a standard deviation of 6 grams.

To estimate the total stock investment by students in this school, two plans are proposed. Plan I would sample 30 students at random, find a confidence interval estimate of their average investment, and then multiply both ends of this interval by 1650 to get an interval estimate of the total investment. Plan II would sample 30 students at random from among the 132 who have investments in the market, find a confidence interval estimate of their average investment, and then multiply both ends of this interval by 132 to get an interval estimate of the total investment.
